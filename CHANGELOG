2. The README file assumes that have to order tasks from 1 to 7, but is listed only 6 tasks.
3. The price of rooms wasn't defined with currency because this value can be defined at backend.

2. Interactive location with map and nearby landmarks.
3. Create photo carousel with thumbnails and automatic slideshow with prev/next buttons and displaying alt data.
4. Sort the room table by columns (occupancy and price), display total and additional information by rooms.
5. Split reviews with pagination and sorting by score.
6. Improve the facilities block.
